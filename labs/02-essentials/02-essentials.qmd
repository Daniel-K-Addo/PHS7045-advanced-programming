# Learning goals

Todayâ€™s lab is the first steps toward designing a response-adaptive randomization (RAR) trial  RAR designs are used in precision medicine trials, such as the [BATTLE trial](https://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article/1/1/44/2198?casa_token=pK1gZcX-FgkAAAAA:KmsD6qnoaOMxqHJlg0VGlmqr2nqIl49Xupuh0FX7nnJXNjtdBwVWsdmVtUIXKdEWQ_e5i9pG), to gather early evidence of treatment arms that work best for a given biomarker.  Throughout RAR, the treatment allocation adjusts depending on which treatment arm looks most promising.  We will focus on the initial steps of coding this design.

The lab is motivated by the paper by Kurt Viele: [Comparison of methods for control allocation in multiple arm studies using response adaptive randomization](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1740774519877836).  It practices:

* Pre-allocating vectors
* Using a loop
* Writing a function

# Notation 

Notation and criteria for study to successfully declare a treatment as efficacious:

* i = 1, $\dots$, N = 228 participants
* t = 0, 1, 2, 3 study arms (t = 0 is control)
* Y$_i$ | t $\sim$ Bern(p$_t$)
* p$_t$ $\sim$ Beta($\alpha, \beta$)

Posterior Distribution P(p$_t$ | y) $\sim$ Beta($\alpha + \sum(y_t = 1), \beta + n_t - \sum(y_t = 1)$ + )

A trial will be successful if, at the end of enrollment, there is sufficiently high probability for at least one treatment arm to be greater than control.

max$_t$ P( p$_t$ > p$_0$ ) > $\delta$

where $\delta$ is chosen to maintain familywise type I error for the study at one-sided 2.5\%.


# Consider 2 different designs:

1.	Equal allocation to four arms throughout design.
2.	RAR where the allocation probability is updated at an interim analysis as follows:

* V$_t$ = P$_t$ (Max)
* V$_0 = min\{\sum V_t \frac{(n_t + 1)}{(n_0 + 1)}, max(V_1, V_2, V_3) \}$

V$_0$, V$_1$, V$_2$, and V$_3$ are renormalized to sum to 1 and are allocation probabilities

Note: A way to calculate P$_t$(Max) is to cbind K = [1000] draws from the posterior distribution of each arm and to see the probability that each arm is the max.


# Lab task:

Write a function for each study design to simulate one trial.  

* N = 228
* Assume the treatment effect is 0.35 for each study arm (the null scenario)
* Interim analyses occur at N = 40 to 200 by 40.  Use equal allocation for first 40 patients for both designs.
* Prior on p$_t \sim$ Beta($\alpha, \beta$)
* $\delta$ to determine a successful trial:
  * Design 1, $\delta = 0.9912$
  * Design 2, $\delta = 0.9892$

For simplicity, have your function return a list of (at least):

1. The probability that the best treatment arm is better than control.
2. The number of patients assigned to each treatment arm.


# If you have more time

* Replicate the design many (10K) times.  Calculate the Type I error.
* Find $\delta$ for each design (supposing you didn't already know it).
* Replicate the study design assuming treatment effects of 
  * p$_0$ = p$_1$ = p$_2$ = 0.35
  * p$_3$ = 0.65
