# Learning goals

* Functions, loops, and vectorized programming
* Writing and simulation a function from a statistical paper
* Debugging, profiling, and improving efficiency

# Lab task

We did not have enough time for most to finish [lab 2](https://uofuepibio.github.io/PHS7045-advanced-programming/week-02-lab.html), and today's lab time is dedicating to finishing the lab.

If you complete the lab, profiling your functions and see if there are rooms to improve efficiency.

Devote any extra time to working on [homework 1](https://uofuepibio.github.io/PHS7045-advanced-programming/hw-01-essentialsSimulations.html) which is a continuation of the lab.
