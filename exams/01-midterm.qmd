Develop an R package that solves a problem.  This could be from your own research or you may get approval to do a related but modified example from ([posted projects](https://github.com/UofUEpiBio/PHS7045-advanced-programming/tree/main/projects)).  

## Deliverables

* R package with a vignette, at least 2-5 pages, including example of real data or simulation (70% of grade)
* Oral presentation of no more than 7 minutes (30% of grade)

## Requirements

Basic requirements include:

* R code is well documented
* Package should be able to install
* Available on github with README.md
* Package sets a class with generic summary, plot, and print functions


Further, the package should incorporate the content of least 3 topics, including: 

* Rcpp
* Vignette built in Quarto
* Simulation and timing
* *apply functions
* data.table
* parallel computing

Bonus points will be given for continuous integration.


## Grading

The grade will be based upon clear communication and coding.
