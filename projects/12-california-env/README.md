# Objectives

Using the CalEnviroScreen_2.0_2014.csv dataset, build a plot--with either ggplot2
or base graphics--using at least one of the environmental related variables,
e.g. Ozone, PM2.5, etc.

What you will need:

1.  Read the plain text file
    [CalEnviroScreen_2.0_2014.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCbiostats/rbootcamp/master/projects/12-california-env/CalEnviroScreen_2.0_2014.csv)
    
2.  (optional) Using maps: Download the shape files from https://data.ca.gov/dataset/ca-geographic-boundaries and read them using the `read_sf` function in the R package [sf](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sf).
