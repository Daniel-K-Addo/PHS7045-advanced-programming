## Learn the basics of a package, then teach us!

There are 13,000 R packages on CRAN, and many more that live on GitHub or other services. Find a package that looks interesting, learn about it, and present the basics to us. 

What to look for: Find a package that has lots of examples or, preferably, vignettes. These will help you get a feel for it. Alternatively, search for blogs that show how to use the package. There may even be a bookdown site with a book about how to use the package!

Suggestions:
* Find a [tidyverse or Rstudio package](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/) we didn't cover
* Check our package recommendations in the the main folder

If you have an area in mind but aren't sure where to look, just ask us, and we might be able to offer some suggestions.
