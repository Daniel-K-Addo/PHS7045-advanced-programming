#  Description

Squares on a plane are colored variously either black or white. We arbitrarily
identify one square as the "ant". The ant can travel in any of the four cardinal
directions at each step it takes. The "ant" moves according to the rules below:

*   At a white square, turn 90° right, flip the color of the square, move forward
    one unit
    
*   At a black square, turn 90° left, flip the color of the square, move forward
    one unit

# Objectives

1.  Using the algorithm described in the previous section, write down an R script
    that simulates the movement of the ant and plot it.

Here is an animation of the expected result.
